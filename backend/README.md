### Backend

This folder contains the backend API for the yralvisa.com project. It is built with Node.js, Express, and Mongoose (for MongoDB interaction).

**Getting Started:**

1.  Make sure you have MongoDB running.
2.  Navigate to this directory in your terminal.
3.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
4.  Create a `.env` file in this directory with your MongoDB connection string (e.g., `MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase`).
5.  Start the server: `npm start` (or `nodemon index.js` if you have nodemon installed)
